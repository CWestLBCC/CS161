Almost every community in America now has a bowling PlaceOne because bowling has become very AdjectiveOne with young PluralNounOne.  Most of them become very AdjectiveTwo at the game.  The main object of the game is to roll a heavy bowling NounOne down the alley and knock down the NumberOne pins which are at the other end.  If you knock them down in one roll, it's called a/an "FunnyNoiseOne."  If it takes two rolls, it's called a/an "FunnyNoiseTwo."  Many alleys have automatic NounThree setters.  Others hire PluralNounTwo who set the pins by NounFour.  The most important thing to remember when bowling is to make sure you have a good grip on the NounFive or you're liable to drop it on your PartOfBody!
